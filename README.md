# Instructions 

To generate an executable from a Python file on Ubuntu 22.04, you can follow these steps:

Install PyInstaller by running the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install pyinstaller
```
Navigate to the directory where your Python file is located:

```
bash
cd/path/to/your/python/file
```
Use PyInstaller to create an executable by running the following command:

```
pyinstaller your_script.py
```
This will create a dist directory with the executable and other necessary files.

You can now run the executable by navigating to the dist directory and running the executable:

```
bash
cd dist
./your_script
```

Note: You may need to install additional libraries or packages if your Python file requires them for the executable to work properly.
